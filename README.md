Seorchestra is an open‑source, Docker‑powered **multi‑agent SEO audit platform**.

Give it a URL and it will crawl, analyze, and generate a **clear, prioritized SEO report** that a developer or SEO specialist can act on immediately.

---

## What Seorchestra does

- **Automated technical SEO audits**
  - Crawls your site, following internal links within sensible limits.
  - Detects issues with status codes, redirects, indexability, canonicalization, meta tags, headings, and links.
- **Insightful reporting**
  - Groups findings by theme (technical, on‑page, internal linking, etc.).
  - Prioritizes issues by severity and potential impact.
  - Produces client‑ready reports (e.g. Markdown/HTML) that are easy to share.
- **Modular agent architecture**
  - Each responsibility (crawling, reporting, future keyword research, performance analysis, etc.) lives in its own **agent**.
  - A central **orchestrator** coordinates work across agents.

Seorchestra is designed to be both **developer‑friendly** (API‑first, containerized) and **SEO‑friendly** (concrete checks, actionable wording).

---

## Who this is for

- **SEO specialists & agencies**
  - Run repeatable audits on client sites.
  - Export reports and integrate them into your existing workflow.
- **Developers & platform teams**
  - Integrate automated SEO checks into CI/CD or monitoring.
  - Expose audit results in internal dashboards.
- **Tool builders**
  - Use the orchestrator API as a backend for your own SEO products.

---

## High‑level architecture

Seorchestra is built as a set of independent, containerized **FastAPI** services:

- **Orchestrator** – main controller and public API.
- **Audit Agent** – crawls a site and runs technical/on‑page checks.
- **Reporting Agent** – turns raw audit data into a human‑readable report.
- **Shared** – common Pydantic schemas used by all services.

Data flow for a single audit:

1. A client (web app or API user) sends a request with a URL to the **Orchestrator**.
2. The Orchestrator calls the **Audit Agent**, which crawls the site and returns a structured `AuditResult`.
3. The Orchestrator passes that `AuditResult` to the **Reporting Agent**, which returns a `ReportResponse` (e.g. Markdown).
4. The Orchestrator returns the job status and report to the client and (in future phases) persists everything.

For a deeper architecture description, see `docs/agent/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Tech stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI (for all services)
- **Orchestration**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Communication**: RESTful HTTP/JSON using shared Pydantic models
- **Planned infrastructure**:
  - PostgreSQL for users, sites, audit jobs, and reports
  - Redis for caching and rate limiting
  - A separate web frontend (e.g. Next.js) consuming the orchestrator API

For an engineering‑focused overview and roadmap, see `docs/agent/TASKS-AND-ROADMAP.md` and `docs/agent/CODING-STANDARDS.md`.

## Quick start (local, with Docker)

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AJakif/SEOrchestra.git
cd SEOrchestra
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example environment file and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For the current MVP, only basic settings are needed. As the project evolves, `.env` will include:

- Service ports
- Database and Redis URLs (when persistence is added)
- Auth and rate‑limiting parameters

### 3. Build and run the stack

This will build images for the orchestrator and agents and start them in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

To see logs from all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 4. Call the API

Once the stack is running, the Orchestrator will be available on `http://localhost:8000` (default).

In the current design, you’ll be able to start an audit with a POST request (exact paths may evolve as implementation progresses):

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audits" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

Then, you’ll query the job status and report with something like:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audits/{job_id}"
```

Refer to the OpenAPI docs (FastAPI’s `/docs` endpoint) once the services are fully wired up.

## For developers

- Start with the **agent docs**:
  - `docs/agent/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md` – high‑level product context and goals.
  - `docs/agent/ARCHITECTURE.md` – service responsibilities and data flow.
  - `docs/agent/TASKS-AND-ROADMAP.md` – phased tasks and current priorities.
  - `docs/agent/CODING-STANDARDS.md` – conventions for structure, style, security, and testing.
- Focus on:
  - **Backend orchestration and agents** in Python/FastAPI.
  - Best practices: auth, rate limiting, safe crawling, caching, observability, and tests.

If you are contributing a new feature, please align it with the phases and guidelines in the docs above.

## For SEO specialists and clients

At a high level, Seorchestra aims to give you:

- A **repeatable SEO audit** you can run any time on any site.
- A **prioritized list of issues**, not just raw data.
- Clear **recommendations** that developers can implement.

A typical workflow will look like:

1. Enter your website URL (and, in the future, options like depth, device type, or language).
2. Wait for the audit to complete.
3. Review the report, which includes:
   - Overall SEO health summary.
   - Lists of critical, major, and minor issues.
   - A checklist of recommended fixes.
4. Share the report with your development team or clients.

As the platform matures, you’ll also be able to:

- Track historical audits and improvements over time.
- Add more specialized analyses (keywords, PageSpeed, Core Web Vitals, etc.).
