**Seorchestra** is an open-source, Docker-powered multi-agent system designed to automate and orchestrate comprehensive SEO audits. Think of it as a conductor, seamlessly coordinating a symphony of specialized AI agents to deliver clear, actionable, and client-ready SEO reports.

## 🚀 Vision

To become the most powerful and flexible open-source platform for automated SEO analysis, built on a modular agent architecture that the community can extend and improve.

## ⚡️ Current Capabilities (MVP)

The initial orchestra consists of two core agents working in concert:

*   **Audit Agent:** A technical SEO crawler that scans websites for critical issues (broken links, missing meta tags, etc.).
*   **Reporting Agent:** An insight generator that transforms raw audit data into a prioritized, human-readable report.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Frameworks:** FastAPI (for agent APIs)
*   **Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Communication:** RESTful HTTP/JSON

---

## 🏗 Architecture

Seorchestra is built as a collection of independent, containerized microservices (agents). This makes it incredibly scalable and easy to contribute to.
